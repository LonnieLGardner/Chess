Welcome to my chess repository. Here I will be uploading FEN and PGN files that I have transcribed from chess books, YouTube videos and various other places for analysis. Obviously I can put all the relevant information on these files but what's not included I will create a more informative list in this README file. I just created this so give me some time to get a good amount of files uploaded.
